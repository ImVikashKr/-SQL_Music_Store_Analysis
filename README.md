# -SQL_Music_Store_Analysis
This project showcases my proficiency in SQL and data analysis through the exploration of a music database. Using SQL queries, I have extracted valuable insights and answered various business-related questions. The project is divided into three question sets - Easy, Moderate, and Advanced.

In the Easy section, I determined the senior most employee based on job title, identified countries with the highest number of invoices, and found the top customers based on total spending.

Moving on to the Moderate section, I crafted queries to analyze rock music listeners, identify the top rock bands based on track count, and filter tracks longer than the average length.

The Advanced section pushed the boundaries of my SQL skills, as I calculated the amount spent by each customer on artists, determined the most popular music genre for each country, and found the customers who spent the most on music within each country.

This project serves as a testament to my problem-solving abilities, analytical thinking, and SQL proficiency. The code and queries are well-documented and organized, making it a valuable resource for others interested in learning SQL or analyzing music data.
